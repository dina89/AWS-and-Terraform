Roles get temporary credentilas when connected to instance.
An application on the instance retrieves the security credentials provided by the role from the instance metadata item iam/security-credentials/ role-name. 
The application is granted the permissions for the actions and resources that you've defined for the role through the security credentials associated with the role.
These security credentials are temporary and we rotate them automatically. We make new credentials available at least five minutes before the expiration of the old credentials.
